/**
 * @brief The TOPIC command is used to change or view the topic of the given
 * channel. If <topic> is not given, either RPL_TOPIC or RPL_NOTOPIC is returned
 * specifying the current channel topic or lack of one. If <topic> is an empty
 * string, the topic for the channel will be cleared.

 * If the client sending this command is not joined to the given channel, and
 * tries to view itsâ€™ topic, the server MAY return the ERR_NOTONCHANNEL (442)
 * numeric and have the command fail.

 * If RPL_TOPIC is returned to the client sending this command,
 * RPL_TOPICWHOTIME SHOULD also be sent to that client.

 * If the protected topic mode is set on a channel, then clients MUST have
 * appropriate channel permissions to modify the topic of that channel. If a
 * client does not have appropriate channel permissions and tries to change the
 * topic, the ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED (482) numeric is returned and the command
 * will fail.

 * If the topic of a channel is changed or cleared, every client in that channel
 * (including the author of the topic change) will receive a TOPIC command with
 * the new topic as argument (or an empty argument if the topic was cleared)
 * alerting them to how the topic has changed. If the <topic> param is provided
 * but the same as the previous topic (ie. it is unchanged), servers MAY notify
 * the author and/or other users anyway.
 *
