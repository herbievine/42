/**
 * @brief The QUIT command is used to terminate a clientâ€™s connection to the
 * server. The server acknowledges this by replying with an ERROR message and
 * closing the connection to the client.
 *
 * This message may also be sent from the server to a client to show that a
 * client has exited from the network. This is typically only dispatched to
 * clients that share a channel with the exiting user. When the QUIT message is
 * sent to clients, <source> represents the client that has exited the network.

 * When connections are terminated by a client-sent QUIT command, servers SHOULD
 * prepend <reason> with the ASCII string "Quit: " when sending QUIT messages to
 * other clients, to represent that this user terminated the connection
 * themselves. This applies even if <reason> is empty, in which case the reason
 * sent to other clients SHOULD be just this "Quit: " string. However, clients
 * SHOULD NOT change behaviour based on the prefix of QUIT message reasons, as
 * this is not required behaviour from servers.
 *
 * @param client
 * @param args
